Indonesian tourism sector shows foreign exchange rise. One of the rising factor is the easier to attain tourism destination information in Indonesia through Internet service like TripAdvisor and Instagram. However, up until now, there is no commercial Internet service which is able to recommend personalized tourism destination. Recommender system is a software technique or tools that is used to provide item recommendation which is suited to user's need. To be able to provide item recommendation as system's output, suitable input is obviously needed. One of technique which can be applied to get recommender system's input is context-aware. Recommender system could possess context-aware properties by utilizing user contextual information such as location and weather.

This final project will be written through mobile based recommender system development and testing which has context-aware properties by using input such as user location, user surrounding weather, local time and tourism category preference, then processed using reasoning to one of model object in knowledge based namely ontology, so that tourism destination recommendation is generated.
